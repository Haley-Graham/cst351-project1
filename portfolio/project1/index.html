            <h3>Challenge</h3>
            <p>I started with a mind map to organize any and all ideas that came to me when talking about Haley’s style as well as what she wanted on her website.</p></div>
          <div class="col-sm-4">
            <h3>Problem</h3>
            <p>Haley’s style does not really fit into any one category. She likes things that are bright and cute, in addition to the dark and creepy. </p></div>
          <div class="col-sm-4">
            <h3>Solution</h3>
            <p>I am going to combine Haley’s girly side with her gothic grunge side to reflect her aesthetic in her website. For colors I will use bright muted colors and some dark saturated colors. For typography I will use something gothic and a sans serif for readability.</p></div>

            <h3>Challenge</h3>
            <p>After making some initial sketches, I refined my favorites and made them more detailed. I made a few iterations of the homepage and secondary pages.</p></div>
          <div class="col-sm-8">
            <h3>Problem</h3>
            <p>After showing Haley the more developed sketches, she told me what she liked most about them and what I should work on. She liked the titles in gothic font and the chain detail, and the layout of the secondary page. She also wanted me to refine the navigation bar for secondary pages.</p></div>

        </div>
          <div class="col-sm-4">
            <h3>Solution</h3>
            <p>Instead of over complicating the navigation for the secondary pages, I decided to keep it consistent and make it the same on every page. I made a simple navigation on the top, but the homepage also has the large buttons you can click on to take you to the other pages.</p></div>

            <h3>Challenge</h3>
            <p>I created a client presentation to present my client with the ideas I had in regards to color, typography, image treatment, and navigation.</p></div>
          <div class="col-sm-4">
            <img class="placeholder2" src="img/image-02.png">

          </div>
          <div class="col-sm-4">
            <h3>Problem</h3>
            <p>Because I got a lot of feedback on my mockups from my client, and I know her pretty well, I was confident when making decisions about the website and did not run into any problems.</p></div>
          <div class="col-sm-4">
            <h3>Solution</h3>
            <p>I chose to use 3 different fonts, a gothic, a funky one, and a sans serif. I chose vibrant colors, both dark and light. A lot of purples, pinks, and blues. Images will be slightly tilted, with a border. The user navigates the site first through sticker shaped buttons.</p></div>

              <div class="col-sm-4">
                <h3>Challenge</h3>
                <p>When creating the mockup, I kept a consistent theme throughout the site. The design is cute and fun, yet is still functional. </p></div>
              <div class="col-sm-8">
                <h3>Problem</h3>
                <p>The only problems I may run into when creating the website is that it may be difficult for me to get it to look exactly like the mockup. I have never used wordpress before, but I don’t think I will have the time to code it to be perfect.</p></div>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-sm-4">
                <h3>Solution</h3>
                <p>I might have to change the layout to be slightly more simple, since I chose to go with a more organic format with floating elements and type that is aligned to different elements.</p></div>

                <h3>Challenge</h3>
                <p>With the mockups I created in Illustrator, I began to recreate them using Wordpress. I have not had much experience with using wordpress, and the website I was able to make does not resemble the mockup like I wanted it to. </p></div>

              <div class="col-sm-4">
                <h3>Problem</h3>
                <p>Using the free Pantheon hosting website, I was finding that there are too many restrictions with using a theme and coding it how I want it to. I was at the point where I was deciding if I should pay to use Bluehost or code it from scratch.</p></div>
              <div class="col-sm-4">
                <h3>Solution</h3>
                <p>I ultimately decided to pay to use Bluehost for a month and started over. The website you see in the pictures is what I made using Bluehost.</p></div>

                    <h3>Challenge</h3>
                    <p>After showing my working prototype site to my client, Haley, she was happy with the outcome even though it turned out different from my mock-ups. The only thing that was missing was the content (text & images).</p></div>
                  <div class="col-sm-8">
                    <h3>Problem</h3>
                    <p>After hearing my client’s feedback, I have a few small changes to make, such as reformatting the about me page, and I will have to update the image and text content on the site. I also need to make sure the site works for a mobile device.</p></div>

                    <h3>Solution</h3>
                    <p>After completing the final revision, here is the finished website. My client, Haley, was happy with the final results. </p></div>
